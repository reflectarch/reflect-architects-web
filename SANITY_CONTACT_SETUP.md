# Sanity Contact Form Setup Guide

## Overview
Your contact page is now connected to Sanity CMS! Contact messages from your website will be automatically stored in Sanity for easy management and response tracking.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

1. **Frontend Form**: The contact form at `/contact` is fully functional
2. **API Route**: Created `/api/contact` to handle form submissions
3. **TypeScript Types**: Added `SanityContactRequest` interface in `src/lib/sanity.ts`
4. **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation for required fields
5. **User Feedback**: Success and error messages for form submissions

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Add Contact Request Schema to Sanity Studio

You need to add the contact request document type to your Sanity Studio configuration:

1. **Copy the schema**: Use the `sanity-schema-contact-request.js` file created in this project
2. **Add to your Sanity Studio**: 
   - If you have a separate Sanity Studio project, copy the schema to your `schemas` folder
   - Add it to your `sanity.config.js` or `sanity.config.ts` file:

```javascript
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import contactRequest from './schemas/contact-request' // Your contact request schema
import consultationRequest from './schemas/consultation-request' // Your consultation request schema
import project from './schemas/project' // Your existing project schema

export default defineConfig({
  // ... your config
  schema: {
    types: [
      project,           // existing
      consultationRequest, // consultation requests
      contactRequest,    // new contact request schema
    ],
  },
})
```

### 2. Deploy Schema Changes

After adding the schema:
1. Deploy your Sanity Studio
2. The "Contact Request" document type will appear in your Studio interface

### 3. Manage Contact Messages

In Sanity Studio, you can now:
1. View all contact messages in a dedicated section
2. Update message status (New ‚Üí Read ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Replied ‚Üí Resolved)
3. Access sender information and message details
4. Sort by submission date or status
5. Archive old messages
